## Hi there 🤓
Python Developer| Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast 
I am a data-driven student with hands-on experience building machine learning models, including deep learning systems for image classification and network intrusion detection. I leverage Python, PyTorch, and analytical workflows to solve real-world problems in data science and cybersecurity. My GitHub projects include neural network models, data mining notebooks, and Python applications demonstrating strong programming fundamentals and creative problem solving.
